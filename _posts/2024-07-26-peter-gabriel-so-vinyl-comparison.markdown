*So* is the fifth studio album released by English singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel. Released in 1986, *So* was an immediate commercial success turning Peter Gabriel from cult hero to a household name with hits such as *Sledgehammer* and *Don't Give Up*. In this review we will compare an [original UK](https://www.discogs.com/release/379036-Peter-Gabriel-So) pressing with the more recent [2016 33â…“ RPM Half-Speed Remaster](https://www.discogs.com/release/9473337-Peter-Gabriel-So).


# Song Variations
Peter Gabriel was meticulous with the running order of the album and originally wanted *In Your Eyes* to be the final track. However, the prominent bassline mandated it be placed towards the outer edges for the original vinyl variant. The original CD had the same running order as the LP but featured *This Is The Picture (Excellent Birds)* as the final track which was not on the LP release.

In 2002 the album was remastered and reissued with a different running order moving *In Your Eyes* to the end of the album.

The 2016 vinyl edition uses the same 2002 remaster and altered running order with *In Your Eyes* as the final track on side B. *This Is The Picture (Excellent Birds)* which was missing from the original LP release is also present as the second to last track on side B. This of course means side B of the 2016 release has a longer running time compared to the original.

# Samples

The following vinyl recordings were captured using a [Motu M4](https://motu.com/en-us/products/m-series/m4/) played on an Audio Technica AT-LP5x turntable with AT-VM95ML cartridge and MoFi StudioPhono preamp.

# Sledgehammer

**Original UK 1986**

**2016 Reissue**

The original pressing has significant sibilance on the vocal in places which is cured on the 2016 release. The 2016 master has more texture to the bass guitar and generally more clarity leading to a more open, spacious presentation. The 2016 master also has a slightly boosted low end compared to the original giving it a touch more kick drum punch.

# Don't Give Up

**Original UK 1986**

The 2016 pressing has more clarity and texture to the vocal and somehow manages to be less fatiguing on the keyboard parts despite offering a crisper, more detailed top end.

# That Voice Again

**Original UK 1986**

**2016 Reissue**
<audio src="https://github.com/scoot-technology/scoot-technology-resources/raw/main/peter_gabriel_so/that_voice_again_2016.wav" controls preload></audio>

Once again the vocal suffers from sibilance in places on the original pressing. The intricate hi-hat and other drum parts cut through the mix and have more texture on the 2016 master.

# Mercy Street

**Original UK 1986**
<audio src="https://github.com/scoot-technology/scoot-technology-resources/raw/main/peter_gabriel_so/mercy_street_1986.wav" controls preload></audio>

**2016 Reissue**

The slightly murkier presentation of the original pressing suits the mood of the song but the 2016 master is technically better with more definition to the vocal, an expanded soundstage and better clarity. That said the 2016 presentation of this track is perhaps a little too clinical for my tastes.

# Big Time

**Original UK 1986**
<audio src="https://github.com/scoot-technology/scoot-technology-resources/raw/main/peter_gabriel_so/big_time_1986.wav" controls preload></audio>

**2016 Reissue**
<audio src="https://github.com/scoot-technology/scoot-technology-resources/raw/main/peter_gabriel_so/big_time_2016.wav" controls preload></audio>

This track really benefits from the extra bass punch and definition on the 2016 mastering which allows the kick drum to break out of the mix and drive the track along. The original mastering sound anemic in comparison.

# In Your Eyes

**Original UK 1986**
<audio src="https://github.com/scoot-technology/scoot-technology-resources/raw/main/peter_gabriel_so/in_your_eyes_1986.wav" controls preload></audio>

**2016 Reissue**
<audio src="https://github.com/scoot-technology/scoot-technology-resources/raw/main/peter_gabriel_so/in_your_eyes_2016.wav" controls preload></audio>

*In Your Eyes* sounds somewhat lackluster on the 2016 release in comparison to the 1986 pressing. The 2016 master has a very narrow soundstage and lacks dynamics compared to the 1986 master. The percussion sounds almost two dimensional as a result and much of the impact of the track is lost.

# Summary
The 2016 release has a slightly boosted low end and additional high frequency detail resulting in extra punch and clarity across the board. The original sounds slightly more congested and muddy as a result but is still a nice presentation of this legendary album. Gabriel's vocal can sound a little more natural on the original pressing at times but there are also occasional problems with sibilance not present on the 2016 release making it overall the better listen.

That said the 2016 release has it's own issues. Most notably the lackluster presentation of *In Your Eyes* at the end of side B. This track appears to suffer from a change of track order and extended running time on the 2016 release making it fall reasonably far short of definitive in my opinion. Perhaps the [45 RPM variant](https://www.discogs.com/release/8744459-Peter-Gabriel-So-) addresses these issues but I don't have one to know for sure.
