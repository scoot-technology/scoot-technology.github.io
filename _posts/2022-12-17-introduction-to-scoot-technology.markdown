First of all welcome to Scoot Technology! In this first post I thought it would be good to give some background on me and the purpose of the Scoot Technology project. So here we go...

# Who Am I?
I'm Scott... a software guy. I stare at code for a living.

The truth of the matter is I'm a 'geek' and all aspects of computing are interesting to me. I started in my teens helping out in a local computer shop building and repairing PCs and to this day it remains a big part of my life and work.

I'm also a smart home fanatic and love finding new ways of automating my home from lights to heating to chicken coops... nothing is 'smart' safe.

That said... before computers and smart homes there was music. Music, hi-fi and home cinema is a big passion of mine to the point that I studied 'Music Systems' at university. This is something that I can trace back to childhood growing up fascinated with my fathers hi-fi system... a towering stack of shiny boxes covered in lights and buttons and speakers taller than me. From the day my Dad gave me a blank casette and let me go nuts with his vinyl and CD collection my enjoyment of hi-fi hasn't waned.

So... Who am I? The software guy, a hardware guy, a smart home fanatic and audio enthusiast (with audiophile tendencies).

But most importantly... I love technology!

# What is Scoot Technology?
Scoot Technology is a place for me to share ideas, projects, reviews and tutorials for like-minded people. The scope will be broad so I will do my best to categorise posts to allow you to more easily follow your interests. Some of the posts will be more technical and 'geek' focused. Others will be more basic or simply reviews of an interesting product. You will find Linux, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) mentioned a lot in the smart home posts.

What you won't find is a Hackaday blog or audiophile reviews. If you are wanting to build a smart home with a soldering iron or enjoy frequency sweep charts in your reviews you won't find that here. Not to say that I am opposed to DIY for the smart home if it is the logical or cost effective solution so no doubt a soldering iron will be mentioned on occasion...

# What next?
So there we go... hopefully that gives you a brief overview of what to expect from Scoot Technology. I have several posts in the works which will delve into multi-room audio, revisiting vinyl playback and smart light switches to name a few...

I look forward to seeing you around!
